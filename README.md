<h1>KEF Kube-1 (MK1) Power Supply PCB Replica project</h1>
<p>I was repairing a severely corrosion damaged KEF Kube-1 (MK1) power supply PCB and after I got the board
working I figured it would be much nicer to get a completely new board made, and then just transplant the
components over to that.</p>

<p>Eventually I ended up figuring out all the components and ordering mostly new parts from Mouser, just
keeping the transformer, heatsinks, and various other bits.</p>
